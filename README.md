# Project Summary

The team was given a dataset with market research information on several of Dell's monitor offerings. The mission was to discover which attributes were most important to consumers and evaluate the impact monitor price changes had on consumer purchasing. 

Conjoint analysis was done to determine the most important monitor attributes and then run a simulated market share analysis to evaluate elasticity. It is worth mentioning that the analysis done were done via Excel for this project.

The highest dollar value upgrades customers are will to spend pertain to resoltuion, response time, and refresh rate of the panel. 

There were 2 reccomendations derived. Firstly when developing new monitors, dell should prioritize features that have high utility for customers. Secondly the current pricing can be adjusting to increase profits, requiring further competitive analyses.

To take this project further having a greater dataset, along with more panel-tech related variables could help create an even better picture of what dell customers are interested in.
